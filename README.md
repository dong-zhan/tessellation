# tessellation
tessellation C++

WANING: I just wrote this, not fully tested, may contain bugs :)

1, this is C++ implementation of tessellation on CPU. <br>
2, in source code, some classes/functions are not defined, but, it's easy to write your own. <br>
3, and in tess.hlsl, it's a short code for removal of tessellation cracks. <br>

4, and made this one, exactly like the one in DirectX. <br>

5, made quad tessellation more rebust by supporting case like this one. <br>
