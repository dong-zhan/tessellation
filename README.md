tessellation C++


quad version has bugs in it, I am fixing it. <br>
seems tri version is good.<br>

1, this is C++ implementation of tessellation on CPU. <br>
2, in source code, some classes/functions are not defined, but, it's easy to write your own. <br>
3, and in tess.hlsl, it's a short code for removal of tessellation cracks.
